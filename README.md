# Proyecto-2

This is the second project I had in Programming 1. It is based on the management of lists for the search of individuals within Costa Rican territory. It was programmed in C++ and has an easy level of difficulty.

###Requirements:
- you need to have downloaded 'ImageMagick' to be able to process images in C++. Once you have downloaded and installed it, nothing else is needed. The IDE is independent but Visual Studio is recommended.
